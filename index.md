### CPSC 120 Labs
*Lab 1, Part 1
    When I was first coding I had a hard time understanding what I was doing. Now that I look back on it, it was super easy and simple. I often go back and look at this to see how far I've come and how much I've understood.
*Lab 4, Part 1
    Lab 4 is where I learned a lot of coding and understanding what is going on with the computer. I was able to understand the language a little bit more in this lab.
*Lab 10, Part 1
    Lab 10 was a little tough for me, but after I asked for help, I learned many things. I was very fascinated by std::trunc(). I learned what the computer is doing behind the scenes when I type in code.
